        <p>Valley Stream Chamber of Commerce</p>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to promote the business interests of the members of the organization and promote the community, attracting additional business, tourism, and people. </p>
        <p>The mission of the Valley Stream Chamber of Commerce is to promote business, add value to our community, foster a beneficial relationship with the community, and help improve the overall quality of life in the Village of Valley Stream and surrounding communities.</p>


        <!-- <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The website is directed to moderately affluent young to middle aged adventurists and families who want a
            quick weekend or day trip. Most of the boating in this area is self-directed, and though we are talking
            about class 1 and 2 rapids, it can still be dangerous for novices. We cater to those wanting to enjoy a safe
            experience, but have little or no training.</p> -->
